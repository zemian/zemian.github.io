One of the reason I delayed the first release of [TimeMachine Scheduler](https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/Home) is that I started the HibernateDataStore implementation while polishing the scheduler API. This gave me chance to look ahead on what I need, as this is the major component in the coming 1.1.0 release. The initial Hibernate impl is actually working now! I have made an snapshot of the latest code today, and you may get a preview on how it works. Get the 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT here:
[https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/downloads](https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/downloads)

I also started a wiki doc on how to use it here:
[https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/HibernateDataStoreConfig](https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/HibernateDataStoreConfig)

So give it a try and let me know what you think so far!
