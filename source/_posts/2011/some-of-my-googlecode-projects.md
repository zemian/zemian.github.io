I have created number of googlecode projects in attempt to try out new codes and ideas in the past. I now have links to all of them in my consolidated playground area [http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/](http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/)

I also kept few Java project templates (Maven based) in there: [http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/source/browse/](http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/source/browse/) These can get you started a project fairly quickly. See the README.txt in each for more details. I have added:

* java-project-template

* servlet-project-template

* springmvc-project-template

There is also the "java-tool" with misc command line programs that I have collected over the years.

I also have stored a more reasonable preferences with Eclipse workspace, and few more custom Cygwin/Bash scripts setup.
