</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My job at Bank of New York Mellon has been keeping me fairly busy lately. It's hard to juggle with Church, a family, a full time job, and time for open source projects. But it seems God has blessed me with not many skills nor hobbies other than programming, which I enjoy the most. So I tend to endup writing more code on weekend when the kids are asleep!</p>
<p>I haven't able to put much time into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/myschedule">MySchedule</a>other than fixed couple of urgent issues recently. If you are using this app, you should get the latest download now.</p>
<p>However, I did spent time helping out on <a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/">Quartz</a>development on their next major feature: <a href="http://svn.terracotta.org/fisheye/browse/Quartz/branches/quartz-2.2-prototype">Queue Jobs</a>. I got most of the initial ground work done. I need to think more about how the concurrent issues with database row locking etc. This feature would allow you to add jobs into a queue structure that the quartz system will process without a trigger (meaning they are process immediatly.) These queue jobs would have a priority value that sorted by the queue as they are processed. We hope this feature would give some users to use the Quartz system to process jobs more effectively.</p>
<p>More of these to come in the future, so stay tuned.</p>
