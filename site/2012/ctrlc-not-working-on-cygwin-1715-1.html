</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>When I installed new package in my Cygwin recently, it also automatically upgraded to latest Cygwin 1.7.15-1 DLL. After this, pressing CTRL+C no longer work</p>
<p>on a running Java process the cygwin shell. I found the reason why this happens, and here is the email I sent to cygwin mailing list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I finally found out what's going on.</p>
<p>I used to have an old cygwin installed (not even sure what version) that only has "C:\Cygwin\Cygwin.bat" to start an terminal. This batch file open a terminal that I can run java.exe, and I used to hit CTRL+C to end it (not only that, it will also invoke the Java's shutdown hook.)</p>
<p>After I upgraded to cygwin 1.7.15-1 (it will auto upgrade when we run setup.exe!). The above behavior no longer works!</p>
<p>It turns out the new cygwin 1.7.15-1 automatically comes with Mintty terminal now, and will default to create a Shortcut to this on desktop. Well I still have a shortcut to "C:\Cygwin\Cygwin.bat". What I discover is that Java will no longer work with terminal that opens with "C:\Cygwin\Cygwin.bat"! But it DOES work with the Mintty terminal!</p>
<p>It's all great for me, because I kind of like Mintty terminal. It's kindda funny because for years I would love to use Mintty, but only to stop because CTRL+C wont' work there. Now we have reverse!</p>
<p>However, I have to point out also that although I can hit CTRL+C in mintty to kill a java.exe process, but it DOES NOT invoke the Java's shutdown hook process! Which is shame, because now I can't test my shutdown procedure code.</p>
<p>I hope cygwin team can look at this further and provide a good solution, even for the Java folks like myself. I can only cope with Windows because of cygwin exists, so kudo to all the cygwin team and their hard work!</p>
<p>Hope also this post will help other Java developers out there.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Zemian </p>
