If you have a large project, you might get this error when trying to do a full build

  Error:java: OutOfMemoryError: insufficient memory

You can fix this by increase memory in two places in the IDE. For example, let says you want to increase to 2GB of memory:

1. Update the `idea64.exe.vmoptions` file with `-Xmx2048m` to increase Java max heap memory size for  your IDE. (Require IDE restart)

2. Go to IDE menu: File > Settings ... > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > "Build process heap size (Mbytes):" and increase it to `2000`.
