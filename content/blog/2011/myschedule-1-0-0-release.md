I have made MySchedule-1.0.0 ready to use.

MySchedule is an open source web application dashboard for Quartz scheduler. Get the war file here: [http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/downloads/list)

It doesn't look pretty at the moment, but for those who are looking  for more Quartz examples, especially on how to use Spring and run  Quartz in a Web Container environment, the MySchedule project should get  you jump started quickly. 

If you have any issues or comments, feel free to enter them at [http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/issues/list](http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/issues/list)

Enjoy!
