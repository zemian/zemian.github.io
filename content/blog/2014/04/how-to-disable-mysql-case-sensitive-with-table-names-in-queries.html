My latest install of MySQL 5.16 on Windows 7 is case sensitive with table names. I much prefer it's case in-sensitive for faster typing and adhoc queries. To do that, I need to edit the my.cnf file (Try running "mysql --help" and it will tell you where it is.)<br />
<br />
At the end of the file, add this line:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">lower_case_table_names = 1</span>
