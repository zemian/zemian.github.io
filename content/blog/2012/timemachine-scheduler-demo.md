I just put out a scheduler demo live on [https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/SchedulerWebDemo](https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/SchedulerWebDemo)

You can poke around the scheduler using Groovy scripting on this quick demo. The bad thing is that everyone in public has access and can add/delete and modify the scheduler! But it's a good way for you to explore around. Check it out and let me know what you think!
