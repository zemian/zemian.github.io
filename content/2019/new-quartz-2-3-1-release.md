Quartz project has little development activities for quite some time now. I finally able to put in some time and help get many bugs fixed up. After more than two years since Quartz last release (April 2017), I am happy to announce the [quartz-2.3.1](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.quartz-scheduler/quartz/2.3.1/jar) is finally out!

This release is a minor release that [fixed many bugs](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/releases/tag/quartz-2.3.1) on the 2.3 series that uses JDK 7. We also cleaned up the [documentation](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/) that generated from `asciidoc` and placed it along with the source repository.

Our [master branch](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz) now target the next [quartz 2.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/milestone/6), which will support the JDK 8 build.
