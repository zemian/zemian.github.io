I have been working with EE 6 stack lately, and I find it quite pleasant and productive. For my own learning purpose, I intend to explore more deeper on some of the major components available on the EE stack.

I have started a [java-ee6-examples](https://github.com/saltnlight5/java-ee6-examples) project in GitHub, and I plan to add my examples and working demo code there, along with some blog posts whenever I can. The project is seperated into sub-modules that a typical EE application would organized: a parent module, a common library jar module and one or more web modules etc. The project is buildable using [Maven 3 tool](http://maven.apache.org/) on command line, and you may use any major IDE that supports Maven (I will try out NetBeans for these demos).

I will also be testing my examples application mainly on Glassfish Server. Glassfish Server is an open source EE application server, and 
its current 4.x release supports EE 7 already (GF 3.x is for EE 6). We should able to run
 any EE 6 applications on GF 4.x without much problems, so for my learning purpose, I will restrict my examples to use EE 6 for now (you will notice that I have to set EE 6 version as dependency in Maven pom file!)

So if you are interested in these, watch this blog for future updates.

To help you started with EE development, I jot down few useful links here.
