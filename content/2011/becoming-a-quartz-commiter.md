I started my [first commit](http://svn.terracotta.org/fisheye/changelog/Quartz/?cs=1575) to the Quartz's svn repository yesterday. I hope to contribute some effort in helping the project. I think the [Quartz](http://quartz-scheduler.org/)is an exellent open source project to work with and it's already been use by many users. The project offer many opportunities in dealing with real world situations. The quartz project has a scheduler layer, cron expression implementation, job persistence storage layer (using JDBC), and many framework components such as plugins and listeners. Many users have integrated Quartz in various environments such in standalone JavaSE, Spring, Servlet container (Tomcat eg), or application server (JBoss eg). In helping this community, I also get a chance to expose to these programming models. It will be great experience to have.
