## How to zip up a release from a hg repository

Did you know `hg archive` command can quickly zip up your project by given a revision or release
name? This is very handy to package up a distribution and share with other who is refusing to use
the same client.

I wrote a simple bash script to do this with couple extras. It will create a zip file with a nice
basename so it&#8217;s easy for unzipping. It also auto generate and append the given revision or tag
name into the RELEASE.txt file, so you know what&#8217;s been released.

Just add the following file into any root of your `hg` based project&#8217;s `bin` directory and it&#8217;s
ready to use.

Note

This script will not tag your repository. It assumed you already have tagged. It simply
will package up a release into a nice little zip file.

file: `bin/zip-release.sh`
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Package a release or snapshot from Hg repository for distribution.

# Usage example:
#   # release a specific tag
#   cd /path/to/project
#   bin/zip-release.sh 1.0.1
#
#   # release a snapshot
#   bin/zip-release.sh
#

# Command line arguments and options
# Assume this script is in bin, which one directory up.
APP_HOME=`cd $(dirname $0)/.. && pwd`
if [[ `command -v realpath` != "" ]]; then
    # resolve symbolic link if possible.
    APP_HOME=`realpath $APP_HOME`
fi
HG_REVISION=`hg id -i`
REL_VERSION=$1
if [[ "$REL_VERSION" == "" ]]; then
    REL_VERSION=$HG_REVISION
fi
REL_NAME="`basename $APP_HOME`-$REL_VERSION"
REL_DIR=$APP_HOME/target/$REL_NAME
REL_ZIPFILE=$REL_DIR/../$REL_NAME.zip

# Generate the zip package
printf "Generating $REL_NAME in directory=`pwd`\n"
mkdir -p $REL_DIR
hg archive -r $REL_VERSION $REL_ZIPFILE

# Auto append revision id to release file.
if [[ -e $APP_HOME/RELEASE.txt ]]; then
    cp $APP_HOME/RELEASE.txt $REL_DIR/RELEASE.txt
fi
printf "$REL_NAME revsion=$HG_REVISION date=`date`\n" >> $REL_DIR/RELEASE.txt
zip -u $REL_ZIPFILE $REL_DIR/RELEASE.txt

# Clean up the tmp rel dir.
rm -r $REL_DIR

printf "$REL_ZIPFILE created.\n"
```
