I have noted the instructions on how to build the HTTPD web server from
scratch in a Cygwin platoform in a Windows 7 PC.

Note that compiling full HTTPD on Cygwin is very slow compare to other
system such as Linux or MacOSX! If you are looking to do full HTTPD
server development, itâ€™s recommend to use a real Linux env instead.

Requirements:
=============

-   Apache HTTPD version `2.4.9`

-   `CYGWIN\_NT-6.1 L328BDS002096US 2.10.0(0.325/5/3) 2018-02-02 15:16 x86\_64 Cygwin`

-   Install the following cygwin packages:

    ```
            autoconf
            make
            automake
            m4
            gcc-core
            libtool
            bison
            flex
            perl
            libapr1-devel
            libaprutil1-devel
            libiconv-devel
            libpcre-devel
            libgdbm-devel
            openssl-devel
    ```
    
Compiling the server
====================

Step 1. Get the source:

    git clone git://git.apache.org/httpd.git
    cd httpd
    git checkout 2.4.9

    # You also need to get the required library sources
    cd srclib
    git clone git://git.apache.org/apr.git
    cd apr
    git checkout 1.6.3
    cd ../
    git clone git://git.apache.org/apr-util.git
    cd apr-util
    git checkout 1.6.1
    cd ../../

Note that unlike the source pre-package you download from Apache site,
the `httpd` source repo does not have `configure` script, and you need
to generate it with `buildconf`. See next step for further instruction.

Note that the current `apr-util` repository is empty in master branch!
This is because they moved the code to `apr` starting version 2.0 dev,
but we still be using version 1.6.x, so we need to explicitly checkout
the tag or branch.

Step 2. Compiling

    ./buildconf
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 \
      --with-included-apr \
      --enable-mpms-shared \
      --with-mpm=worker \
      --enable-mods-shared=most
    make
    make install

The option `--prefix=/usr/local/apache2` tells the build to install the
software into a user specific location.

The option `enable-mpms-shared` will make the mpm\_module to be shared
library so you can switch to different threading model if you want.
Default to `worker` which should work nicely in Cygwin env.

The option `enable-mods-shared` will make most of the modules as shared
libraries. You can use `all` for full server.

The option `--with-included-apr` tells the build to use the `srclib/apr`
we have downloaded. Here you can use system installed `apr` if you like.
For an example:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 \
    --with-apr=/usr/bin/apr-1-config \
    --with-apr-util=/usr/bin/apu-1-config \
    --enable-mpms-shared \
    --with-mpm=worker \
    --enable-mods-shared=most
