There are few updates with TimeMachine Scheduler project:

1. The project has a new home: 
[https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/Home](https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/Home) 
2. I've been updating with SNAPSHOT downloads frequently lately, and the zip file binary distribution is fairly stable now. We are close to making the first official release.
3. I've been working hard to update the ReferenceManual under wiki so users can get started and use it effectively.

Give the project a try and let me know what you think!
