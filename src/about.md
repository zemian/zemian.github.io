Hello, 

My name is Zemian Deng, and this is my personal blog site. My interests are in software development and sharing knowledge. The first programming language I learned is `C` back in 1995. Since then I have spent 20+ years using various programming languages in different industries. I have spent major part of my career working with `Java` programming language and related technologies. In between I have also enjoyed using other scripting languages such as `Python` and `Bash` for automation and creating productive tools etc. Recently I have also gotten into Front-End development with `JavaScript` and `NodeJS`.

In general, I like to be pragmatic when it comes to software design. I think simple code makes less buggy software.

I use this blog as my personal journal to record tips and notes on what I have learned. Feel free to leave a comment below if you share the same interests. You will also find more about me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zemian-deng-profile) profile and Open Source project contributions at my [GitHub](https://github.com/zemian/) account.

## My Programming Experience
