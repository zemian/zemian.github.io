		<h1>Taming those Java editors on MacOSX</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>26 August 2012</em></p>

	<p><p>Today, I learned that you can open multiple Eclipse instances in MacOSX like this</p>

<pre><code>$ open -n -a Eclipse
</code></pre>

<p>This comes pretty handy if you want a separate workspace per large project that has dozen or so modules (try importing the Camel or SpringFramework 
project source and you will see what I mean!)</p>

<p>The <code>-a</code> is for name of an application to open, and <code>-n</code> means to open with new instance.</p>

<h1>Finding a programmer friendly text editor on MacOSX</h1>

<p>Despite I use Eclipse for most of my large Java projects, I still often find myself the need of a plain text editor. I use plain text editor for most
of my scripting programming. I also use it for notes taking, text file browsing, or even writing Blog post in markdown format!</p>

<p>I guess for most programmers, choosing an Editor is a very personally thing. So I am not here to convert anybody. However, for those who never heard of 
<a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>, you ought to give it a try. It's open source, full features, programmers friendly text editor that works 
across many of OS systems consistenly. It works because it's Java based! If you use one of decent computer now a day, the performance 
is excellent as well.</p>

<p>However, for some strange reason, the jedit installer on MacOSX doesn't comes with a normal java command line script wrapper. The only thing 
I can see is the actual binary under <code>/Applications/jEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/jedit</code>. We can certainly run this as full jedit command, but then 
it always liter the console with strange GUI warnings. So a better way to run it is actually to use the <code>open</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>$ open -a jedit $HOME/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can add this in your <code>.bash_profile</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>function jedit(){ open -a jedit "$@" ; }
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use <code>jedit</code> command on the terminal.</p>

<h2>Some of my favorite features of jEdit</h2>

<ul>
<li>It's open source and has very active community of users.</li>
<li>It works across MacOSX, Windows and Linux Desktop.</li>
<li>Support many common programming language syntax highlights.</li>
<li>Support multi columns editing.</li>
<li>Support rich feature search (reg ex, hyper-search, all buffers search, search and replace etc.)</li>
<li>Support multi buffers tabs editing.</li>
<li>Supports Macro recording and scripting.</li>
<li>Support plugin extension and there are many external plugins available (eg: XML formater, Diff viewer, SFTP client/editing, etc).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Openning other stuff on MacOSX</h1>

<p>The little <code>open</code> command can open not just application, but it can also open directories or files by extension associations. For
example, to configure any <code>.properties</code> files to be open by jEdit, try the the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Finder to browse and find one of properties</li>
<li>Right click, "Open With" > "Other..."</li>
<li>Choose "jEdit" under Applications folder.</li>
<li>Enable "Always Open With", then click Open button.</li>
</ol>

<p>This change should affect your Terminal <code>open</code> command as well, and if you run <code>open my.properties</code>, your jEdit should pop up.</p>

<p>You can find more options by running it without any options, and it will print you full help page.</p>

<pre><code>Usage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-b &lt;bundle identifier&gt;] [-a &lt;application&gt;] [filenames] [--args arguments]
Help: Open opens files from a shell.
      By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.  
      If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.
Options: 
      -a                Opens with the specified application.
      -b                Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.
      -e                Opens with TextEdit.
      -t                Opens with default text editor.
      -f                Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.
      -F  --fresh       Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows. Saved persistent state is lost, excluding Untitled documents.
      -R, --reveal      Selects in the Finder instead of opening.
      -W, --wait-apps   Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).
          --args        All remaining arguments are passed in argv to the application's main() function instead of opened.
      -n, --new         Open a new instance of the application even if one is already running.
      -j, --hide        Launches the app hidden.
      -g, --background  Does not bring the application to the foreground.
      -h, --header      Searches header file locations for headers matching the given filenames, and opens them.
