title: Reduce recent project list size in IntelliJ

When opening a project from IntelliJ IDE, it will give you a list of
menu that contains your recent projects. This list however has default
of 50 items max, and sometimes I find it stretched the menu popup too
long and covered some of IDE the status line (which I need to verify the
project path to be open). Itâ€™s a pity that there is obvious normal IDE
Settings to change this, but today I found a post that shows how you can
do it this:

1.  Go to menu: `Help->Find Action->Registry`

2.  In the diablog table, find the "ide.max.recent.projects" key entry
    and change the value to your liking (eg: `10`)
