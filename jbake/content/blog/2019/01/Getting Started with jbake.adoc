I started using https://jbake.org/ for https://zemian.github.io/[my blog site] here at GitHub page. It's a Java based static site generator that has decent options. For Java developers, it's easy to learn and use. I can customize the site with Freemarker (and other templates as well).

So far I am pretty happy with this.

== Getting Started

----
mkdir hello-site
cd hello-site
jbake -i
jbake -b -s
----

The `-b` option is for baking (generating) the content, and the `-s` is to run a server for testing it. The default output of the site will be in `output` folder. You can change it as `jbake -b -s . my-site-output`
