I found an old series of articles that introduced Oracle JET by [Chris Muir](https://blogs.oracle.com/author/chris-muir) on DZone. These articles seem dated way back in 2016 (with OJET v3 ?), but the core concepts are still valid. In fact many of these introductions are now captured in the [Oracle JET Developer Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/developer-tools/jet/8.1/develop/index.html) already. But these articles are short and good read. I don’t know Chris personally, but thanks for publishing these.
