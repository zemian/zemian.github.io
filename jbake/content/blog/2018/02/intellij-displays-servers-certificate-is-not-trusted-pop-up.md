I get this "Server’s Certificate is not trusted" pop-up window once in a
while when I am in different network. If you know your IDE is already
working fine, then you can get rid of it by go to below location.

`File | Settings | Tools | Server Certificates for Windows and Linux`

Then click on "Accept non-trusted certificates automatically".
