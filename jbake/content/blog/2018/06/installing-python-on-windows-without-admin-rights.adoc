To install Python on Windows without Admin Rights:

1. Download binary from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

2. Run the following in `cmd.exe` terminal.

  mkdir %USERPROFILE%\apps\python-2.6.6
  msiexec /a python-2.6.6.amd64.msi /qb TARGETDIR=%USERPROFILE%\apps\python-2.6.6

NOTE: Starting Python 3.5 the official downloads site already has "Windows x86-64 embeddable zip file" version you may download. This you may install without Admin Rights already.
