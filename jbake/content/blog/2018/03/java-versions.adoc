How to check Java version from compiled classes

  javap -cp target/classes -verbose com.zemian.hellojava.App | grep 'major version'
  major version: 49

You may use this forumla to get the JDK version: `<class_file_major_ver> - 44 = JDK version`. So this means above class is targeted for JDK 5 (1.5).

Here are more examples of different class format versions matching to JDK versions.

  major version: 45.3 = Java 1.1
  major version: 46 = Java 1.2
  major version: 47 = Java 1.3
  major version: 48 = Java 1.4
  major version: 49 = Java 1.5
  major version: 50 = Java 1.6
  major version: 51 = Java 1.7
  major version: 52 = Java 1.8
  major version: 53 = Java 9
  major version: 54 = Java 10
